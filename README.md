# 100 Days of Swift - UIKit

This repository contains my personal attempts at solving challenges and milestone projects from the "100 Days of Swift" UIKit course by Hacking with Swift.

## Course Overview

"100 Days of Swift" is an extensive learning program that covers various aspects of app development using the UIKit framework in Swift. The course is designed by Paul Hudson, the creator of Hacking with Swift, and it provides a hands-on approach to learning Swift and UIKit by building real-world projects.

The original course can be found at: [Hacking with Swift - 100 Days of Swift - UIKit](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100)


## Disclaimer

Please note that the projects and solutions in this repository are my own personal attempts and may not always reflect the most optimal or perfect implementation. The primary purpose of this repository is to document my learning journey throughout the "100 Days of Swift" UIKit course and to serve as reference for those who want to compare their solutions with mine.
